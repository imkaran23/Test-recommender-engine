In this directory, notebooks are provided to give a deep dive of hybrid recommendation algorithms. The notebooks make use of the utility functions ([reco_utils](reco_utils)) available in the repo.

| Notebook | Environment | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [lightfm_deep_dive](lightfm_deep_dive - Copy.ipynb) | Python CPU | Deep dive into hybrid matrix factorisation model with LightFM.

Details on model training are best found inside notebook.
